[6-7269000030844] Appeal Content, 9/30/2020

I am not sure why the update got rejected; the app has been on Play store for more than a year, and I made no changes other than adding a new feature for Dark Mode and fixed couple of bugs.

I would like if you can tell me what exactly is problem and I will address it.

I checked Developer Policy Center and especially reviewed https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888072 in detail.

There is "Unauthorized Use of Copyrighted Content" section, and I am assuming that my app is fine because my app store description is the same as it was before, and my app doesn't contain any copyrighted content inside itself.

There is also "Encouraging Infringement of Copyright" section.  My app is an online comic book reader; it does allow users to access online content that may be copyrighted (like Youtube).  But note that my app doesn't advertise downloading the content and it's greatly limited.

Overall since Notification doesn't have details I would like to know what to fix.
